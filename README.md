## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann - Sales Forescast Project](https://github.com/endhel/Rossmann-Store-Sales-Forecasting)

In this project, i developed a Machine Learning model able to forescat sales with **Mean Absolute Percentage error accuracy(MAPE): 0.09**.
The performance of this model would increase **revenue of R$7 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### [InvestBot - a bot for classifying stocks on the stock exchange using data mining techniques](https://github.com/endhel/InvestBot)

In this project, i developed a model capable of classifying stock market stocks as reliable or unreliable to invest, with the purpose of helping investors to make good investments and, above all, not lose money.

## Data Analysis - Insight Projets

### [House Rocket - Insights Project](https://github.com/endhel/house-rocket-insights)
